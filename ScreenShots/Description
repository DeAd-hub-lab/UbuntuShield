First Decided to create the UI with figma , then converting the figma formatted file to tkinter file using external repo: https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer

Things didn't went well , the gui was not fully functionable ; therefore decided to code on our own.

Used Python tkinter for the gui and Bash scripting for the Command which needs to be executed on the Linux distro.

** Currently Working with Functionality development in the GUI software.
